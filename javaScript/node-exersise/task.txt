 Node Exercise
Create two pages , LogEvents.js and index.js files in your folder. 
Create a new package.json file using npm init 
 
Install three packages, nodemon, uuid and date-fns
 
Date-fns is just used for format  const dateTime = `${format(new Date(), 'yyyyMMdd\tHH:mm:ss')}`
 
nodemon is used to automate node to run automatically without need to cancel the terminal and re-runing the app again.
make sure you connfigure your scripts for nodemon

 
In LogEvents, import the uuid and date-fns packages and just create a function called LogEvents
 
Make sure LogEvents is an async function so you can be able to use Promises . 
 
Inside LogEvents, heyðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ just a simple thing, print a new uuid and new date and a message in one variable called logItem
 
Take the logItem and append it to a new file eventLogs.txt that is contained inside Logs folder
 
PLEASE DONT CREATE THE FOLDER MANUALLY, CREATE IT USING NODE AND PROMISES, REALLY EASY
 
//first we check if a folder doesnt exist hence we create it
        //then we create a file to the folder
        //then we appendData to it, so appendFile will automatically create
        //and append data to a file if didnt exist

Next steps
 
Go to Index.js file and import the LogEvent function exported from LogEvents.js and use it isnide a new EventEmitter
 
then use your EventEmmiter to emit a your event with a message new log event emmited. This should be wrapped iside a setTimeOut function of 2000 ms. 
 
remember the message is what was passed as a parameter from the function LogEvent function

create a simple html and css landing page . 
 
Put a navbar with two button home and sign-up on the home page.
 
When the server is running on  localhost, should display the web page , now do this, when the home button is clicked it juts routes to "/" which is still the home page but when the sign-up page is clicked it will route to "/signup" and show the sign-up form. make the navbar also appera on the sign-up paage so that you can go back to home with the top button Home .
